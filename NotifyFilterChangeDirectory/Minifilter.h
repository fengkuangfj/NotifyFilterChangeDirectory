MiniFilter initialization and unload routines.
*************************************************************************/

/*++

Routine Description:

This is the initialization routine for this miniFilter driver.  This
registers with FltMgr and initializes all global data structures.

Arguments:

DriverObject - Pointer to driver object created by the system to
represent this driver.

RegistryPath - Unicode string identifying where the parameters for this
driver are located in the registry.

Return Value:

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS.

--*/

__in PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject,

/*++

Routine Description:

This routine is called whenever a new instance is created on a volume. This
gives us a chance to decide if we need to attach to this volume or not.

If this routine is not defined in the registration structure, automatic
instances are alwasys created.

Arguments:

FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
opaque handles to this filter, instance and its associated volume.

Flags - Flags describing the reason for this attach request.

Return Value:

STATUS_SUCCESS - attach
STATUS_FLT_DO_NOT_ATTACH - do not attach

/*++

Routine Description:

This routine is called at the start of instance teardown.

Arguments:

FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
opaque handles to this filter, instance and its associated volume.

Flags - Reason why this instance is been deleted.

Return Value:

None.

Routine Description:

This routine is called at the end of instance teardown.

Arguments:

FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
opaque handles to this filter, instance and its associated volume.

Flags - Reason why this instance is been deleted.

Return Value:

None.

/*++

Routine Description:

This is the unload routine for this miniFilter driver. This is called
when the minifilter is about to be unloaded. We can fail this unload
request if this is not a mandatory unloaded indicated by the Flags
parameter.

Arguments:

Flags - Indicating if this is a mandatory unload.

Return Value:

Returns the final status of this operation.

--*/
NTSTATUS
PtUnload(
__in FLT_FILTER_UNLOAD_FLAGS Flags

/*++

Routine Description:

This is called when an instance is being manually deleted by a
call to FltDetachVolume or FilterDetach thereby giving us a
chance to fail that detach request.

If this routine is not defined in the registration structure, explicit
detach requests via FltDetachVolume or FilterDetach will always be
failed.

Arguments:

FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
opaque handles to this filter, instance and its associated volume.

Flags - Indicating where this detach request came from.

Return Value:

Returns the status of this operation.

/*************************************************************************
MiniFilter callback routines.
*************************************************************************/

/*++

Routine Description:

This routine is the main pre-operation dispatch routine for this
miniFilter. Since this is just a simple passThrough miniFilter it
does not do anything with the callbackData but rather return
FLT_PREOP_SUCCESS_WITH_CALLBACK thereby passing it down to the next
miniFilter in the chain.

This is non-pageable because it could be called on the paging path

Arguments:

Data - Pointer to the filter callbackData that is passed to us.

FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
opaque handles to this filter, instance, its associated volume and
file object.

CompletionContext - The context for the completion routine for this
operation.

Return Value:

The return value is the status of the operation.

PtPreOperationPassThrough(

/*++

Routine Description:

This routine is called when the given operation returns from the call
to IoCallDriver.  This is useful for operations where STATUS_PENDING
means the operation was successfully queued.  This is useful for OpLocks
and directory change notification operations.

This callback is called in the context of the originating thread and will
never be called at DPC level.  The file object has been correctly
referenced so that you can access it.  It will be automatically
dereferenced upon return.

This is non-pageable because it could be called on the paging path

Arguments:

FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
opaque handles to this filter, instance, its associated volume and
file object.

RequesterContext - The context for the completion routine for this
operation.

OperationStatus -

Return Value:

The return value is the status of the operation.

Routine Description:

This routine is the post-operation completion routine for this
miniFilter.

This is non-pageable because it may be called at DPC level.

Arguments:

Data - Pointer to the filter callbackData that is passed to us.

FltObjects - Pointer to the FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS data structure containing
opaque handles to this filter, instance, its associated volume and
file object.

CompletionContext - The completion context set in the pre-operation routine.

Flags - Denotes whether the completion is successful or is being drained.

The return value is the status of the operation.
